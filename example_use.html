    <p>Why take out pet insurance for senior cats and dogs? Cats and dogs often require more veterinary care as they
        grow older; pet insurance can help by covering a portion of your eligible vet bills. Other benefits of pet
        insurance for senior pets may include: Cover for accidental injuries, including car accidents, poisoning,
        snake/insect bites and wounds Policies for older animals with limited benefits for specified illnesses (age
        limits apply) Being able to choose your own vet or clinic for treatment A financial safety net and peace of mind
        if your senior pet needs emergency care Coosing pet insurance for senior pets If you’re looking to buy or switch
        to a new pet insurance policy for your older furry companion, please consider the following: Basic policies for
        older pets often have a lower benefit percentage (i.e. reimbursement rate), so you’ll have to pay a larger
        portion of eligible vet bills. For example, you may only be able to claim up to 60% back for eligible
        treatments, meaning you’d have to foot the remaining 40% of the bill. Comprehensive pet insurance is usually
        available for pets up until they turn nine. If you take out a suitable policy before that, your pooch or feline
        can be protected for life – if you maintain continuous cover past this age. Optional routine care is also
        available for older pets up to nine years of age as an add-on for new policyholders. Some insurers offer
        accident-only cover for senior pets before or up to 16 years of age. A basic level of cover for injuries will be
        cheaper than more comprehensive accident and illness cover.</p>

    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/pet-insurance/senior-pets/">source</a> page
        already has three internal links using phrases "Comprehensive pet insurance",
        "accident-only cover" and "accident and illness cover". This indicates that our model correctly predicted
        "accidental cover" but also extended it to "accidental cover for senior pets" which gives additional context to
        the link. This could be considered an anchor text modification suggestion. Interestingly the model also underlines the phrase "routine care" which doesn't have a suitable target indicating
        an opportunity for a new page. Perhaps the most obvious hint is at the very start of the text segment:</p>

        <p>Cats and dogs often require more veterinary care as they grow older; pet insurance can help by covering a portion of your eligible vet bills. The phrase "pet insurance" has a <a href="https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/pet-insurance/">very clear target page</a> in this case, and while you don't need a BERT model to help you with basic keyword matching it's important to note that it's not always as clean-cut as with this example.</p>
        <p>To make these recommendations work at scale a form of similarity search would be beneficial where we not only recommend the link location and anchor text but also its target URL.</p>
